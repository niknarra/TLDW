12,31.8,34.36," and in turn, I've taught some of the best."

22,56.36,59.36, This is the only cookery course you'll ever need.
23,61.36,63.36, Welcome to my ultimate cookery course.
24,63.36,65.36," Packed with cooking tips, information,"
25,65.36,68.36, and 100 recipes to stake your life on.
26,68.36,71.36, The frying pan is one of your best friends.
27,71.36,73.36, It's so versatile in the kitchen.
28,73.36,75.36," Learning to use it with ease is a must,"
29,75.36,77.36, and I'm going to show you how.
30,77.36,80.36," First up, my delicious pan-fried pork chops"
31,80.36,83.36, with sweet and sour peppers.
32,84.36,86.36," Whether it's in the restaurant or even at home,"
33,86.36,89.36, one of my golden rules for producing fantastic food
34,89.36,91.36, is learning to cook with confidence.
35,91.36,93.36," This recipe is so straightforward,"
36,93.36,95.36, but tastes absolutely amazing.
37,98.36,101.36, Pan on. Get that nice and hot.
38,101.36,104.36," You think of the sort of density of a pork chop,"
39,104.36,107.36, how it needs a little bit of help.
40,107.36,110.36, Sweet and sour peppers go brilliantly well.
41,110.36,112.36," First, slice the peppers."
42,112.36,115.36," That's the flat side of the pepper, so stand it up."
43,115.36,117.36, Try to slice a pepper on the side.
44,117.36,119.36, It's a nightmare.
45,119.36,121.36, There's the center. Start off.
46,121.36,123.36, It's almost like sort of peeling an orange.
47,123.36,125.36, Go all the way around and down.
48,127.36,129.36," And look, that's the one."
49,129.36,131.36," Now, place the pepper down."
50,131.36,133.36, Three finger rule.
51,133.36,135.36," One finger in front, two behind."
52,135.36,138.36," Pinky, holding it down. Thumb holding it nice and flat."
53,138.36,141.36," The flatter the vegetables, the more confident you are"
54,141.36,143.36, when you slice.
55,143.36,145.36," So, don't worry about the speed."
56,145.36,147.36, Just let the knife do the work
57,147.36,149.36, and take your time.
58,149.36,151.36, Speed comes.
59,151.36,154.36, The most important thing is to get your technique right.
60,154.36,156.36, Red onion.
61,159.36,161.36," Now, sweet and sour peppers."
62,161.36,163.36, Olive oil in.
63,165.36,167.36," I'm going to saute them,"
64,167.36,169.36, which is just the chef's turn for shallot fry
65,169.36,171.36, on a high heat for maximum taste.
66,172.36,174.36, Some salt and pepper.
67,174.36,176.36, Add a tablespoon of sugar.
68,176.36,178.36," Sugar helps to break down the peppers quicker,"
69,178.36,180.36, but caramelizes the onions.
70,180.36,182.36, Fry them in a frying pan. Perfect.
71,182.36,184.36, It's one of the sort of basic essential tools
72,184.36,186.36, of any kitchen because it's so multi-purpose.
73,186.36,189.36," Great for sauteing, tossing."
74,189.36,191.36, Great for cooking fish and meat.
75,192.36,194.36, Push away and pull back.
76,194.36,196.36, Push away and pull back.
77,196.36,198.36, That hissing is something you need to hear constantly
78,198.36,200.36, on a high heat for maximum taste.
79,200.36,202.36," The minute that's gone, your peppers and your onions"
80,202.36,204.36, start to boil and you really want them to saute.
81,204.36,206.36, You can now start to see it glistening
82,206.36,208.36, in a way that it's starting to caramelize.
83,208.36,210.36, Sugar's working usefully.
84,210.36,212.36, That's ready.
85,212.36,214.36, Pour the red wine vinegar in.
86,216.36,218.36, Smells incredible.
87,218.36,220.36, It helps to stain the peppers as well.
88,220.36,222.36, Look at the glaze now.
89,222.36,224.36, You can see the sugar.
90,224.36,226.36, It's worked as magic.
91,226.36,228.36, Turn down the gas.
92,228.36,231.36, Add a couple of tablespoons of fresh extra virgin olive oil.
93,231.36,234.36, Flip them stew for 2 to 3 minutes.
94,236.36,239.36," Now, I want to make the peppers nice and light"
95,239.36,241.36," and sort of sweet, aromatic."
96,241.36,243.36, Just roll the basil.
97,243.36,245.36, Almost like a big cigar.
98,245.36,247.36, It's nice.
99,247.36,249.36, Basil in.
100,249.36,251.36, And then literally cook it out for 30 seconds.
101,251.36,253.36, I want them off.
102,254.36,256.36, Beautiful.
103,256.36,258.36," OK, pan back on."
104,258.36,260.36, Now for the pork chops.
105,260.36,263.36, I want to make sure they don't curl up in the pan.
106,263.36,265.36," If they start curling up in the pan,"
107,265.36,267.36, they're going to cook unevenly.
108,267.36,269.36, A few simple cuts through the rind
109,269.36,272.36, means the chop stays flat and cooks evenly.
110,272.36,274.36, Point the knife down.
111,274.36,276.36, Flip through.
112,276.36,278.36, This season them beautifully.
113,278.36,280.36," Nice, large shards of pepper."
114,280.36,282.36, Punch that through lightly.
115,282.36,284.36," Darn tea, that seasoning."
116,284.36,286.36, It's going to stay there.
117,286.36,289.36," Hot pan, such a garlic and such a thyme."
118,289.36,292.36," And the garlic, take a couple of cloves."
119,292.36,294.36," Don't peel it, don't chop it."
120,294.36,296.36, Just knife on.
121,296.36,298.36, Crush it.
122,300.36,302.36, Olive oil in.
123,302.36,304.36, Just start them to smoke.
124,304.36,306.36," Top of the chop, in."
125,306.36,308.36, Lay away from me.
126,308.36,310.36, Nice.
127,312.36,314.36, Keep that heat in the pan.
128,314.36,316.36, Put the garlic in there early.
129,316.36,318.36, A nice fragrant bunch of thyme.
130,318.36,321.36, See how the pork has stayed nice and flat.
131,321.36,323.36, Turn that over.
132,323.36,325.36, Beautiful.
133,325.36,327.36, I want a little bit of thyme underneath there.
134,327.36,329.36, Start squeezing that garlic out.
135,329.36,331.36, I want the flavour coming out.
136,331.36,333.36, Butter in.
137,333.36,335.36, Thin slices of butter.
138,335.36,337.36, Tilt the pan and baste.
139,337.36,340.36, So I'm sort of speeding up the cooking process.
140,340.36,344.36," At the same time, I'm keeping the pork chops really nice and moist."
141,344.36,346.36, And now look at the colour of that butter.
142,346.36,349.36, It's almost like sort of a nut brown.
143,349.36,351.36, Check the colour on the other side.
144,351.36,353.36, Beautiful.
145,353.36,355.36," When they're that thick,"
146,355.36,357.36, 3.5 to 4 minutes each side.
147,357.36,359.36," 30 seconds from now, they're going to be medium."
148,359.36,361.36, So I'm going to take them out and let them rest.
149,361.36,363.36, The secret to perfectly moist pork chops
150,363.36,366.36, is letting them rest almost as long as they're cooked in the pan.
151,366.36,368.36, A nice spoon
152,368.36,370.36, of these peppers.
153,370.36,373.36, The basil smells incredible.
154,373.36,375.36, Get that garlic on there.
155,375.36,377.36, Be generous with that vinegar out from the peppers
156,377.36,379.36, because it really is incredible.
157,381.36,383.36, Do two things simple.
158,383.36,385.36, Like that.
159,385.36,387.36, Pork and peppers.
160,387.36,389.36, And your confidence is going to shoot through the roof.
161,389.36,391.36, That stunning pork chop with sweet and sour peppers.
162,393.36,396.36, The frying pan is so simple but incredibly useful.
163,396.36,399.36," With this one pan, you can make a million different dishes."
164,399.36,401.36," The more you cook with your frying pan,"
165,401.36,403.36, the more your confidence will grow.
166,403.36,406.36, Here are three of my favourite easy pan-fried dishes.
167,410.36,413.36," First up, pan-fried scallops with crunchy apple salad."
168,417.36,419.36," Get a frying pan smoking hot,"
169,419.36,421.36, essential for quick pan-frying.
170,422.36,424.36, Add olive oil.
171,425.36,428.36, Then season scallops with salt and pepper.
172,428.36,431.36," Starting at the top, put clockwise into the pan"
173,431.36,433.36, so you know which one to turn first.
174,436.36,439.36," Scallops have firm, white, sweet flesh and cook in minutes."
175,444.36,446.36," Next, salad."
176,446.36,447.36, Lamb's lettuce.
177,447.36,449.36, Matchsticks of apple.
178,451.36,453.36, Seasoning.
179,454.36,456.36," Lemon, zest and juice."
180,462.36,464.36," Add olive oil, then toss."
181,466.36,468.36, Turn the scallops when golden.
182,468.36,470.36, Go clockwise around the pan.
183,474.36,477.36, Then squeeze in lemon juice and give the pan a shake.
184,479.36,481.36, Finish with lemon zest.
185,482.36,484.36, Ready in under 10 minutes.
186,484.36,488.36," My first pan-fried dish, scallops with crunchy apple salad."
187,490.36,493.36, My next super simple pan-fried recipe is
188,493.36,496.36, chicken and chicory in masala sauce.
189,501.36,503.36, Season the chicken breasts.
190,503.36,505.36, Add to hot olive oil.
191,505.36,507.36, Skin side down.
192,507.36,509.36, Lay away from you to stop the oil splashing.
193,512.36,514.36, Slice chicory.
194,514.36,516.36, This versatile vegetable can be red or white.
195,516.36,519.36, Has a lovely bitter taste and is great cooked or raw.
196,522.36,524.36, Crush a clove of garlic and add.
197,524.36,526.36, Then sprigs of thyme.
198,529.36,531.36," When the chicken skin is crisp, turn over."
199,532.36,534.36, Along with the chicory.
200,535.36,539.36," For the sauce, add masala, a sweet fortified wine from Sicily."
201,542.36,544.36, Then 150 ml of chicken stock.
202,547.36,549.36," To make the sauce one little rich and glossy,"
203,549.36,551.36, add butter and simmer for 10 minutes.
204,556.36,558.36, Plate up and spoon over the sauce.
205,560.36,562.36," Cooked in under 20 minutes,"
206,562.36,564.36, chicken and chicory in masala sauce.
207,568.36,570.36, My final dish cooked in the oven.
208,571.36,573.36, The versatile frying pan is
209,573.36,575.36, sea bream with tomato and herb salsa.
210,580.36,583.36, Fry fillets of sea bream skin side down in hot olive oil.
211,584.36,588.36," If they buckle up, press gently down for perfect even cooking."
212,588.36,590.36, Then season.
213,591.36,595.36," Sea bream has firm white flesh, perfect for pan frying."
214,596.36,598.36," Next, the salsa."
215,599.36,600.36, Heat olive oil.
216,601.36,603.36," Add half cherry tomatoes,"
217,603.36,606.36, pitted black olives and season.
218,610.36,615.36," After a minute on a low heat, add coriander, basil and lemon."
219,618.36,620.36, Combine and leave to infuse.
220,622.36,625.36," As the sea bream cooks, it goes opaque."
221,626.36,629.36," When it's two thirds from the top, turn over."
222,632.36,634.36," Faced, fry and it's done."
223,638.36,643.36, Sea bream with tomato and herb salsa ready in under 15 minutes.
224,646.36,650.36," One pan, three simple, impressive and absolutely delicious dishes."
225,650.36,651.36, Beautiful.
226,652.36,657.36," Coming up on my ultimate cookery course, along with 100 recipes to stake your life on,"
227,657.36,661.36, I'm going to give you 100 quick cooking tips to make your life in the kitchen easier.
228,663.36,665.36," First up, how to keep your knife sharp."
229,667.36,670.36, It's far harder working in the kitchen with a blunt knife than it is with a sharp knife.
230,670.36,675.36," The secret behind keeping a sharp knife, sharpen it before and every time you use it."
231,675.36,678.36," First, grip the steel. Feel really comfortable about holding the steel."
232,678.36,681.36, Imagine you're holding a tennis racket or you're playing squash.
233,681.36,683.36, You've got to be really comfortable with it.
234,683.36,686.36," Now, 45 degrees, confident grip, confident grip with the knife."
235,686.36,690.36, This is the butt of the steel. Really important to keep your fingers behind there.
236,690.36,694.36," You never grip a steel with your fingers over that because the knife comes back in,"
237,694.36,698.36, you've just lost a finger. Always grip behind.
238,698.36,704.36, Nice long strokes so we get the whole of the blade over steel.
239,704.36,708.36, Stroke. And we start from the bottom to the top.
240,708.36,711.36," So there, across."
241,711.36,713.36," There, across."
242,713.36,717.36, Slow strokes over the top of the steel and then come back in the knee.
243,717.36,719.36, Then back in the knee.
244,719.36,722.36, It is so dangerous working in the kitchen with a blunt knife.
245,722.36,724.36, You can cause so much damage.
246,724.36,727.36," Working with a sharp knife is ten times quicker, more efficient."
247,727.36,731.36," Now, that's ready to start chopping."
248,732.36,735.36," To stop your chopping board rocking or slipping,"
249,735.36,738.36," a great tip is to simply wet a kitchen cloth, kitchen paper,"
250,738.36,741.36, or tea towel and place it underneath.
251,741.36,744.36," Now, you can chop with confidence."
252,746.36,750.36," My next top tip is, get the most out of your humble veg peeler."
253,750.36,753.36," It's brilliant for slicing ultra-thin ribbons of veg,"
254,753.36,755.36, perfect for Asian dishes.
255,755.36,760.36," Great for making long, delicate parmesan shavings to top soups and salads."
256,761.36,764.36, It also makes wonderful chocolate curls.
257,766.36,769.36, Your peppermill is more versatile than you might think.
258,769.36,772.36," Tighten the top screw to get finely ground pepper,"
259,772.36,774.36, ideal for soups and sauces.
260,775.36,777.36," For general seasoning, you want it medium-ground,"
261,777.36,780.36, so set the screw in the middle.
262,780.36,782.36," And loosen it right off for coarse pepper,"
263,782.36,785.36, perfect for steaks and fish.
264,788.36,789.36, Peeling garlic.
265,789.36,792.36," For one clove, simply bash it with the back of a knife,"
266,792.36,794.36, and the skin comes off easily.
267,795.36,798.36," For a whole head, crush, separate into a bowl,"
268,799.36,802.36, cover and shake hard for about 10 seconds.
269,803.36,806.36, Then simply pick out the peeled cloves.
270,810.36,812.36," This is my ultimate cookery course,"
271,812.36,814.36, 100 recipes to stake your life on.
272,814.36,817.36, I'll be showing you a roast chicken recipe to die for.
273,817.36,820.36, Hold the drum and slice straight through.
274,820.36,822.36," But first, like any good chef,"
275,822.36,825.36, I'm always looking to get great ingredients at the right price.
276,826.36,828.36, My shopping mantra is simple.
277,828.36,830.36," First, rely on your senses."
278,830.36,833.36," Make sure whatever you're buying, it looks, smells, and really feels good."
279,833.36,836.36," And if you get the chance, taste it before you buy it."
280,836.36,839.36," Second, is to recognise that knowledge is crucial."
281,839.36,842.36, The more you know about where your ingredients come from
282,842.36,844.36," and how they've produced, the better."
283,844.36,846.36," So, ask lots of questions and learn."
284,848.36,851.36, You're never too old to learn from experts.
285,851.36,853.36," And when it comes to buying great birds,"
286,853.36,855.36, the one person who knows what to look for
287,855.36,859.36," is a ward-winning fifth-generation master butcher, Danny Lidgate."
288,859.36,863.36, Poultry is a great meat because there's many different types of birds
289,863.36,865.36, that's worth tasting.
290,865.36,868.36, The variation of flavours between different birds to birds is massive.
291,868.36,871.36," Turkey is a great lean meat that's available all year round,"
292,871.36,873.36, not just for Christmas.
293,873.36,875.36, Anybody who's worried about eating fatty meat
294,875.36,877.36, is a really healthy flavoursome meal.
295,877.36,880.36, Game birds. People don't try them often enough.
296,880.36,882.36," Once they're shot, they're hung up for a little while,"
297,882.36,884.36," but a few days at least,"
298,884.36,886.36, it means the meat's going to be more tender.
299,886.36,888.36, It all adds its flavour to the birds.
300,888.36,891.36, You've got a wood pigeon and a red-legged partridge.
301,891.36,894.36, Both really good and cooked really quickly.
302,894.36,896.36," When you're buying a chicken,"
303,896.36,899.36, some of the things to look out for is obviously the smell.
304,899.36,901.36," And when you're smelling a good quality chicken,"
305,901.36,903.36, you can tell it's a good quality chicken.
306,903.36,905.36," When you're smelling a good quality chicken,"
307,905.36,907.36, you can tell the difference.
308,907.36,909.36, The skin's a nice white colour
309,909.36,911.36," and it smells like a fresh, chickeny smell."
310,911.36,913.36," When you're buying from a good butcher,"
311,913.36,915.36," you'll find you tend to get the giblets as well,"
312,915.36,917.36, which is basically the neck and other organs.
313,917.36,919.36, This is great for making gravy.
314,919.36,921.36," Once you have cooked it,"
315,921.36,923.36, you can use all the off-cuts for other things.
316,923.36,925.36," Stir-frys, curries, pasta dishes,"
317,925.36,929.36," save the bones, use the bones for stocks and soups."
318,929.36,931.36, They're really packed for the flavour.
319,931.36,934.36," And remember, there are lots of different breeds of chicken."
320,934.36,937.36, All have different characteristics and flavours.
321,937.36,940.36, So shop around and find the ones you love.
322,940.36,943.36, Here are three of my all-time favourites.
323,943.36,945.36," The label, Anglais."
324,945.36,947.36, These come from an old British breed.
325,947.36,950.36," They've got smaller breasts, but the meat's delicious."
326,951.36,954.36," The black leg, a fantastic French variety,"
327,954.36,958.36, succulent with bags of flavour and really meaty thighs.
328,958.36,960.36, And the poulis de brès.
329,960.36,962.36, This is the Rolls Royce of Chickens.
330,962.36,964.36," Rich, gamey and delicious."
331,964.36,966.36, One for special occasions.
332,968.36,971.36," I think people should maybe try and buy less meat,"
333,971.36,973.36, but aim for the best quality.
334,973.36,975.36, You're only going to get out what you put in.
335,975.36,977.36," By putting the best quality into a dish,"
336,977.36,979.36, you're going to get the best results.
337,981.36,983.36," No matter how seasoned the chef you are,"
338,983.36,986.36, there are always new ingredients and recipes to get fired up about.
339,986.36,988.36," So, if a tired old recipe is getting you down,"
340,988.36,991.36, spice it up with fresh ideas and flavours.
341,993.36,996.36," My next recipe is an old classic roast chicken,"
342,996.36,998.36," but with a simple twist, it takes on a new life"
343,998.36,1000.36, and it's guaranteed to impress.
344,1001.36,1003.36," One of the things I love about cooking,"
345,1003.36,1006.36," and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove,"
346,1006.36,1009.36, is that there's always something new to learn every day.
347,1009.36,1012.36," New ingredients, new techniques and new cuisines."
348,1017.36,1019.36, Start off with the stuffing.
349,1020.36,1024.3600000000001," It's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be,"
350,1024.3600000000001,1026.3600000000001, because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist
351,1026.3600000000001,1030.3600000000001, and gives a delicious texture inside the bird.
352,1030.3600000000001,1033.3600000000001, I'm going to start off with cured cerizo.
353,1033.3600000000001,1035.3600000000001," This is a traditional Spanish sausage,"
354,1035.3600000000001,1040.3600000000001," and it's garlicky, spicy, incredibly meaty."
355,1040.3600000000001,1043.3600000000001, That gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing.
356,1043.36,1045.36, Get that cerizo in.
357,1046.36,1049.36, Start cooking that down and getting all those oils out.
358,1049.36,1053.36, A little touch of olive oil in there to get it going.
359,1053.36,1055.36," All right, onions."
360,1055.36,1057.36, Chopped.
361,1058.36,1060.36," Add the onions to the cerizo,"
362,1060.36,1062.36," and in a matter of seconds, they'll change colour"
363,1062.36,1064.36, as they soak up all the flavour.
364,1064.36,1068.36," That lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage,"
365,1068.36,1071.36, and now the onions smell incredible.
366,1071.36,1073.36, Garlic.
367,1074.36,1076.36, Garlic in.
368,1076.36,1079.36, Fresh thyme. Just hold it down and put your fingers on there.
369,1079.36,1081.36," And it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice,"
370,1081.36,1083.36, fragrant little time flowers.
371,1083.36,1086.36, You can hear it crackling in the background.
372,1086.36,1088.36, These are cannellini beans.
373,1088.36,1091.36," They're waxy, very soft,"
374,1091.36,1094.36," and so delicious, but very dense."
375,1094.36,1097.36," But for stuffing, they're so robust, nothing breaks down."
376,1097.36,1099.36, Drain them off.
377,1100.36,1102.36, In.
378,1102.36,1105.36, They're going to take on all that juice as well from the chorizo.
379,1105.36,1107.36," I'm going to season them now because they're very dense,"
380,1107.36,1109.36, so it needs some help.
381,1109.36,1112.36, That looks like it's a dish on its own.
382,1112.36,1114.36, Good enough to eat now.
383,1114.36,1117.36, I want to sweeten things up a little bit.
384,1117.36,1119.36," Tomatoes, half dried."
385,1119.36,1121.36, In.
386,1121.36,1123.36, That sweetens up.
387,1123.36,1125.36, The stuffing.
388,1125.36,1127.36, Beautiful.
389,1127.36,1129.36, The stuffing's ready.
390,1129.36,1131.36, Look at the colour of everything.
391,1131.36,1133.36, It looks Spanish. It looks delicious.
392,1133.36,1135.36," Now, stuffing the chicken."
393,1135.36,1138.36, I like taking off these little knuckles.
394,1138.36,1140.36," As the chicken cooks,"
395,1140.36,1142.36, the skin stretches over the bone.
396,1142.36,1144.36, You can get a really nice drum
397,1144.36,1146.36, and take off those little wing tips as well.
398,1146.36,1148.36," Salt, pepper."
399,1148.36,1150.36, So important.
400,1150.36,1153.36," Now, we've got stuffing."
401,1153.36,1156.36, I want to go right inside the chicken.
402,1156.36,1158.36, Push it down.
403,1158.36,1160.36, This really helps to cook the bird evenly
404,1160.36,1162.36, because you're pushing out all the empty spaces
405,1162.36,1164.36, in the carcass.
406,1164.36,1167.36," And take a nice, large lemon."
407,1167.36,1169.36, Push the lemon in.
408,1169.36,1171.36, Pick up the parsley's nose.
409,1171.36,1173.36, Pull the skin over.
410,1173.36,1175.36, Olive oil on top.
411,1175.36,1177.36, Salt.
412,1177.36,1179.36, Some pepper.
413,1179.36,1183.36, A teaspoon of paprika.
414,1183.36,1185.36, Sprinkle it on.
415,1185.36,1188.36, Take a look at your hands and sort of rub that in.
416,1188.36,1191.36, You'll see what the paprika's doing to the chicken.
417,1191.36,1194.36," Put this like sweet, spicy marinade."
418,1194.36,1198.36," It's not even roasted yet, but it looks delicious."
419,1198.36,1200.36, 400 ml of white wine.
420,1200.36,1202.36, Same quantity of water.
421,1202.36,1204.36, That helps the chicken to steam.
422,1204.36,1206.36, Chicken in.
423,1206.36,1209.36, Be generous with the thyme sprigs.
424,1209.36,1212.36, Make sure the foil is folded tightly around the roasting tray
425,1212.36,1216.36," so the chicken steams in the oven, keeping it moist and juicy."
426,1216.36,1218.36, Into the oven.
427,1221.36,1224.36, Cook for one hour at 180 degrees with the foil on.
428,1224.36,1226.36, Nice.
429,1226.36,1228.36, Take it out and remove the foil lid.
430,1228.36,1231.36, Then give it another 30 minutes to crisp up that skin.
431,1233.36,1235.36, Look at that.
432,1235.36,1237.36, So important.
433,1238.36,1243.36, So important to make sure you take that tin full off with half an hour to go.
434,1243.36,1245.36, Beautiful.
435,1245.36,1247.36, Pierce that open.
436,1247.36,1249.36, Squeeze it in.
437,1249.36,1251.36, That delicious gravy.
438,1251.36,1253.36, Mix that into the tray.
439,1253.36,1255.36, And sieve that.
440,1256.36,1262.36," That's a really nice fragrant, lemony, spiced roasting juices to finish."
441,1262.36,1266.36," Before we cut up the chicken, take out amazing stuffing."
442,1268.36,1270.36, Mmm.
443,1270.36,1272.36, Incredible.
444,1272.36,1275.36, I'd have that with chicken over potatoes any day.
445,1275.36,1278.36, And then just get your chicken roasting juices.
446,1278.36,1287.36," Now, to cut the chicken up, hold the drum and slice straight through."
447,1287.36,1291.36, And there's that wonderful drum and the thigh.
448,1291.36,1293.36, Through the wishbone.
449,1294.36,1296.36, Off.
450,1296.36,1302.36, Slice with the point at an angle so you can see the texture of that amazing roast chicken.
451,1302.36,1304.36, Just take my cooking juices.
452,1304.36,1308.36, Just want to give that really nice sort of lemony flavour.
453,1308.36,1310.36, Over my chicken.
454,1310.36,1312.36, And there you go.
455,1312.36,1318.36," A delicious, very charming stuffed roast chicken."

483,1402.36,1405.36, This is the only cookery course you'll ever need.
484,1407.36,1409.36, Welcome to my ultimate cookery course.
485,1409.36,1411.36," Packed with cooking tips, information,"
486,1411.36,1413.36, and 100 recipes to stake your life on.
487,1413.36,1416.36, Right. This is my guide to cooking with spice.
488,1416.36,1421.36," Adding big, gutsy flavors, using spices at the beginning of cooking,"
489,1421.36,1423.36, and then simply letting the dish slow cook
490,1423.36,1427.36, is a brilliant way of getting maximum flavor with minimum effort.
491,1427.36,1429.36, My first recipe melts in the mouth.
492,1429.36,1431.36," And because the oven does most of the work,"
493,1431.36,1433.36, it's a cinch to make.
494,1433.36,1435.36," Slow cooked, fiery lamb."
495,1435.36,1437.36, Cooking's all about being bold and adventurous.
496,1437.36,1440.36, And this dish is exciting because it's slowly cooked.
497,1440.36,1443.36," And the longer it cooks, the more flavor it becomes."
498,1446.36,1448.36, Marinate in the lamb first.
499,1448.36,1451.36," Chillies, we're going to use a mixture of red and green."
500,1451.36,1453.36, Take off the tops.
501,1453.36,1455.36, And just slice.
502,1456.36,1458.36, In.
503,1458.36,1460.36, Garlic.
504,1460.36,1462.36, Crushed.
505,1462.36,1464.36, Don't worry about chopping these ultra fine.
506,1464.36,1466.36, Just get it in there.
507,1466.36,1468.36, Cooking for up to three hours.
508,1468.36,1471.36, Everything sort of blends and almost sort of
509,1471.36,1473.36, purrs itself together.
510,1473.36,1475.36, Smoke paprika.
511,1475.36,1477.36, Goes brilliantly well with the chillies.
512,1477.36,1479.36, Two teaspoons.
513,1479.36,1482.36, In. A touch of dried oregano.
514,1484.36,1486.36, Some little cumin seeds.
515,1486.36,1489.36, The blend and the fragrance that they give out
516,1489.36,1491.36, Is extraordinary.
517,1491.36,1493.36, They release a little oil as well.
518,1493.36,1495.36, And help to tenderise the lamb.
519,1495.36,1497.36, Touch of salt.
520,1497.36,1499.36, Pepper.
521,1499.36,1501.36, Cinnamon.
522,1501.36,1503.36, That sort of sweetens up the lamb.
523,1503.36,1505.36, Olive oil.
524,1505.36,1507.36, Just a tablespoon.
525,1507.36,1509.36, And the olive oil helps to sort of stick
526,1509.36,1511.36, All those wonderful spices to the lamb.
527,1511.36,1513.36, Jump in.
528,1513.36,1515.36, Just start really rubbing.
529,1515.36,1517.36, At this stage you can leave the lamb to marinate
530,1517.36,1519.36, From half an hour to overnight.
531,1519.36,1521.36, Allowing the spices to really penetrate the meat.
532,1521.36,1523.36, Giving amazing results when you tuck in.
533,1523.36,1525.36, Delicious.
534,1525.36,1527.36, Vegetables.
535,1527.36,1529.36, Carrots.
536,1529.36,1531.36, And onions.
537,1531.36,1533.36, And that's it.
538,1533.36,1535.36, Slice.
539,1535.36,1537.36, Secret slicing.
540,1537.36,1539.36, Vegetables for braising is not getting too thin.
541,1539.36,1541.36, You slice the onions too thin.
542,1541.36,1543.36, They burn.
543,1543.36,1545.36, You've got that horrible char taste on that slow braised.
544,1545.36,1547.36, And that's it.
545,1547.36,1549.36, It's a good idea to keep the meat low heat.
546,1549.36,1551.36, Making the meat incredibly moist.
547,1551.36,1553.36, And beautifully tender.
548,1553.36,1555.36, So the secret of braising
549,1555.36,1557.36," is having a really nice thick, durable pan."
550,1557.36,1559.36, Get that nice and hot.
551,1559.36,1561.36, Just a touch of olive oil.
552,1561.36,1563.36, Lamb in.
553,1563.36,1565.36, Hold the bone.
554,1565.36,1567.36, Because you're in control then.
555,1567.36,1569.36, Into the pan.
556,1569.36,1571.36, Want that white fat
557,1571.36,1573.36, to start rendering.
558,1573.36,1575.36, And then we're going to add this
559,1575.36,1577.36, chilies.
560,1577.36,1579.36, Cinnamon.
561,1579.36,1581.36, In.
562,1581.36,1583.36, Mix that up.
563,1583.36,1585.36, And don't be scared.
564,1585.36,1587.36, You're not burning this.
565,1587.36,1589.36, You're sort of searing the lamb shanks.
566,1589.36,1591.36, And this is the important part right at the very beginning.
567,1591.36,1593.36, We're going to have a color on the lamb.
568,1593.36,1595.36, Which washes off as it braises in the oven.
569,1595.36,1597.36, So be generous with that color.
570,1597.36,1599.36, The vegetables in.
571,1599.36,1601.36, Wow.
572,1601.36,1603.36, And get the lamb.
573,1603.36,1605.36, Sat.
574,1605.36,1607.36, On top of the vegetables.
575,1607.36,1609.36," Now, deglaze the pan with red wine."
576,1609.36,1611.36, Deglaze these.
577,1611.36,1613.36, You're cleaning the bottom of the pan.
578,1613.36,1615.36, And you're getting that amazing flavor.
579,1615.36,1617.36, Washed off and lifted up into that sauce.
580,1617.36,1619.36, Can really transform that dish.
581,1619.36,1621.36, Always deglaze.
582,1621.36,1623.36, Then bring to the boil.
583,1623.36,1625.36, And cook for about 10 minutes to reduce.
584,1625.36,1627.36, The wine's reduced down by half.
585,1627.36,1629.36, Now for the stock.
586,1629.36,1631.36, And then into the oven.
587,1631.36,1633.36," Now, don't cover it."
588,1633.36,1635.36," When you cover it, all the conversation comes off."
589,1635.36,1637.36, The lid.
590,1637.36,1639.36, Your lamb becomes gray.
591,1639.36,1641.36, All this effort and that exciting spice gets washed away.
592,1641.36,1643.36, No lid.
593,1643.36,1645.36, And in the oven for three hours.
594,1645.36,1647.36, A slow cook on a low heat of 160 degrees.
595,1647.36,1649.36, Gives the spices time to work.
596,1649.36,1651.36, And transform the meat so it's mouth-watering tender.
597,1651.36,1653.36," Now, look at those."
598,1653.36,1655.36, Out.
599,1655.36,1657.36, On to a plate.
600,1657.36,1659.36, You can just see that meat sliding down.
601,1659.36,1661.36, Juicy.
602,1661.36,1663.36," And then, crevy tender."
603,1663.36,1665.36, Grab it by the shank.
604,1665.36,1667.36, Roll them round.
605,1667.36,1669.36," That rich, delicious sauce."
606,1669.36,1671.36, Look at that.
607,1671.36,1673.36, You can get your sauce.
608,1673.36,1675.36, Nice.
609,1675.36,1677.36, Beautiful.
610,1677.36,1679.36, Just get some mint.
611,1679.36,1681.36, Don't chop it.
612,1681.36,1683.36, Just pick that fresh mint and let it snow.
613,1683.36,1685.36, And there you go.
614,1685.36,1687.36, Delicious. Melting in the mouth.
615,1687.36,1689.36, Lamb shank. Amazing.
616,1695.36,1697.36," To get the most out of your spices,"
617,1697.36,1699.36, there's only one piece of kit that you need.
618,1699.36,1701.36," Pesto and water. I mean, they look fantastic,"
619,1701.36,1703.36, and it's essential for any good kitchen.
620,1703.36,1705.36, These things are so versatile.
621,1705.36,1707.36," These ancient kitchen tools are perfect for everything,"
622,1707.36,1709.36," from pesto's to dressings,"
623,1709.36,1711.36, and cost them around 15 quid.
624,1711.36,1713.36," Use to grind spices,"
625,1713.36,1715.36, and you'll max out on flavour.
626,1715.36,1717.36," Get perfect textures, and always be totally in control."
627,1717.36,1719.36," Make sure you've got a nice, large"
628,1719.36,1721.36, circumference of the bowl.
629,1721.36,1723.36," So you can grind away the heavier,"
630,1723.36,1725.36," the more durable they are,"
631,1725.36,1727.36, the more confidence it gives you when you're pounding.
632,1727.36,1729.36, And there's almost a way of confirming
633,1729.36,1731.36," homemade, hand-pounded."
634,1731.36,1733.36," Grab yourself a pesto and water,"
635,1733.36,1735.36, and soon you'll be spicing with ease.
636,1735.36,1737.36, Spices are a brilliant way to add
637,1737.36,1739.36, an extra layer and a depth of complexity
638,1739.36,1741.36, to any dish.
639,1741.36,1743.36, Learning to use them properly will really improve your cooking.
640,1743.36,1745.36, Here are three more of my super simple
641,1745.36,1747.36, spice recipes to get you going.
642,1747.36,1749.36," First up,"
643,1749.36,1751.36, a very easy chili and spice white bait.
644,1755.36,1757.36, Start with the spice coating.
645,1757.36,1759.36, And then you'll add the spices.

647,1761.36,1763.36, And then you'll add the spices.

652,1775.36,1777.36, Add chili flakes
653,1777.36,1779.36, and grind in a pestle and mortar to make a
654,1779.36,1781.36, fiery fine powder.
655,1781.36,1783.36," Combine with plain flour, season"
656,1783.36,1785.36, and mix.

662,1797.36,1799.36," fish that are healthy, delicious"
663,1799.36,1801.36, and cooking minutes.
664,1801.36,1803.36," Once golden,"
665,1803.36,1805.36, they're done.
666,1805.36,1807.36, Fantastic with garlic mayonnaise
667,1807.36,1809.36, or a simple squeeze of lemon.
668,1811.36,1813.36," Ready in under 10 minutes,"
669,1813.36,1815.36, chili and spice white bait
670,1815.36,1817.36," an easy, simple, spicy dish."
671,1821.36,1823.36, My next amazingly aromatic recipe is
672,1823.36,1825.36, roasted squash hummus.
673,1831.36,1833.36, Start with my take on
674,1833.36,1835.36," razzalhanout, a classic Moroccan spice blend."
675,1837.36,1839.36," In a dry pan, toast cinnamon,"
676,1839.36,1841.36," cloves, coriander,"
677,1841.36,1843.36, fenugreek and fennel seeds.
678,1845.36,1847.36, Then add mustard seeds and cumin.
679,1847.36,1849.36," When the seeds start to pop,"
680,1849.36,1851.36, they're ready.
681,1851.36,1853.36, Add paprika
682,1853.36,1855.36, and grind into a fine powder.
683,1859.36,1861.36," For the hummus, peel and chop"
684,1861.36,1863.36, butternut squash.
685,1863.36,1865.36, Put on a baking tray
686,1865.36,1867.36," and add garlic, simply bashed"
687,1867.36,1869.36, and chopped ginger.
688,1869.36,1871.36," Drizzle with olive oil,"
689,1871.36,1873.36, season and sprinkle over the spice mix.
690,1873.36,1875.36, Then roast in a hot oven
691,1875.36,1877.36, for half an hour until soft.
692,1881.36,1883.36, Allow to cool and place in a blender.
693,1885.36,1887.36," Add tahini, a nutty paste made from sesame seeds,"
694,1887.36,1889.36," cooked chickpeas,"
695,1889.36,1891.36, a dash of lemon juice
696,1891.36,1893.36, and a drizzle of olive oil.
697,1895.36,1897.36, Blitz until luxuriously creamy and textured.
698,1897.36,1899.36," Spices toasted for maximum flavour,"
699,1899.36,1901.36, amazing roasted squash hummus.
700,1903.36,1905.36," My final, deliciously spicy dish is"
701,1905.36,1907.36, curry spice sweet corn soup.
702,1913.36,1915.36," First, the fragrant curry paste."
703,1915.36,1917.36, Roast coriander and cumin seeds
704,1917.36,1919.36, until aromatic.
705,1921.36,1923.36," Then grind, adding crushed garlic,"
706,1923.36,1925.36," chili powder, turmeric"
707,1925.36,1927.36, and finely chopped ginger.
708,1927.36,1929.36, Bring together with olive oil
709,1929.36,1931.36, to form a thick paste.
710,1931.36,1933.36," For the soup, fry finely"
711,1933.36,1935.36, chopped onions in olive oil.
712,1939.36,1941.36, Add the curry paste
713,1941.36,1943.36, and cook to release the flavours.
714,1945.36,1947.36," Add cubed potatoes, chicken stock"
715,1947.36,1949.36, and season.
716,1951.36,1953.36," When the potato has softened,"
717,1953.36,1955.36, stir in cream corn.
718,1957.36,1959.36, Then add whole sweet corn kernels
719,1959.36,1961.36, with some of the juices
720,1961.36,1963.36, and transfer to a blender
721,1963.36,1965.36, and blitz until smooth.
722,1969.36,1971.36," For texture, add more whole sweet corn."
723,1971.36,1973.36, Heat and it's ready to serve.
724,1979.36,1981.36, Wonderfully satisfying
725,1981.36,1983.36, curry spice sweet corn soup
726,1983.36,1985.36, that packs an amazing taste.
727,1987.36,1989.36, It's an amazingly aromatic punch.
728,1991.36,1993.36, Three more stunning recipes
729,1993.36,1995.36, that make cooking with spice simple.
730,1995.36,1997.36, Incredible.
731,1999.36,2001.36, This is my guide
732,2001.36,2003.36, to cooking with spice.
733,2003.36,2005.36," Next up, my shopping guide"
734,2005.36,2007.36, to buying spices.
735,2009.36,2011.36," When I buy my spice,"
736,2011.36,2013.36, I only want the best
737,2013.36,2015.36, and it always pays to get expert advice.
738,2015.36,2017.36, Burgot Eireth has been selling
739,2017.36,2019.36, every spice under the sun in London
740,2019.36,2021.36, for over 20 years.
741,2021.36,2023.36, She really knows what she's talking about.
742,2023.36,2025.36, I love spices.
743,2025.36,2027.36," They smell, the texture, the color."
744,2027.36,2029.36, Spices are so versatile.
745,2029.36,2031.36, Something very simple can be really
746,2031.36,2033.36, transforming to something really delicious.
747,2033.36,2035.36, With thousands of aromatic ingredients
748,2035.36,2037.36," on her shelves, if it smells good,"
749,2037.36,2039.36, she sells it.
750,2039.36,2041.36," If you buy spices, buy them whole."
751,2041.36,2043.36," Then you can try roast them,"
752,2043.36,2045.36, and then they will release the essential oils.
753,2045.36,2047.36, Whole spices you can keep for years.
754,2047.36,2049.3599999999997, Give them a good
755,2049.3599999999997,2051.3599999999997," bushing, wine bottle"
756,2051.3599999999997,2053.3599999999997, with your rolling pin or whatever.
757,2053.3599999999997,2055.3599999999997, And you see there is still aroma
758,2055.3599999999997,2057.3599999999997," and you can taste it, you smell it,"
759,2057.3599999999997,2059.3599999999997, then it's fine.
760,2059.3599999999997,2061.3599999999997, There's four main spices.
761,2061.3599999999997,2063.3599999999997," One is sweet, one is sour,"
762,2063.3599999999997,2065.3599999999997," one is bitter, and one is hot."
763,2065.3599999999997,2067.3599999999997, This is cinnamon
764,2067.3599999999997,2069.3599999999997, and that is really a great example
765,2069.3599999999997,2071.3599999999997, of a sweet spice.
766,2071.36,2073.36, If you buy a cinnamon quill like this
767,2073.36,2075.36, you have to check that you have
768,2075.36,2077.36, loads of different layers in here.
769,2077.36,2079.36, Then you can either grind this
770,2079.36,2081.36, or you'd break a piece off.
771,2081.36,2083.36, I mean this doesn't smell of anything now.
772,2083.36,2085.36, But if you roll it in your hand
773,2085.36,2087.36, just quickly like this
774,2087.36,2089.36, and then you smell it again
775,2089.36,2091.36, this is just unbelievable.
776,2091.36,2093.36, If you have spaghetti bolognese
777,2093.36,2095.36, put a pinch of cinnamon in it to bring out the flavor.
778,2095.36,2097.36, So this is one of those
779,2097.36,2099.36, really special spices.
780,2099.36,2101.36, Sour like a lemon
781,2101.36,2103.36, but it has a salty aftertaste.
782,2103.36,2105.36, I use this anywhere
783,2105.36,2107.36, from marinades to salad.
784,2107.36,2109.36, You haven't lived unless you tried it.
785,2109.36,2111.36, A great example for a bitter spice
786,2111.36,2113.36, would actually be turmeric.
787,2113.36,2115.36, This is actually a root
788,2115.36,2117.36, in the ground like ginger.
789,2117.36,2119.36, Use it very sparingly
790,2119.36,2121.36, about that much.
791,2121.36,2123.36, We'll actually color you with curry
792,2123.36,2125.36," or rice dish, wonderful yellow."
793,2125.36,2127.36," Watch your fingers, you get really yellow fingers from it."
794,2127.36,2129.36, Then we come to the hot spices.
795,2129.36,2131.36, One spice that I couldn't miss
796,2131.36,2133.36, and that is Hungarian paprika.
797,2133.36,2135.36, Paprika
798,2135.36,2137.36, is the powdery form
799,2137.36,2139.36, of a bell pepper.
800,2139.36,2141.36, What makes the Hungarian paprika
801,2141.36,2143.36, different is that they actually
802,2143.36,2145.36, grow it on vineyards.
803,2145.36,2147.36, It's sort of between the vines.
804,2147.36,2149.36, It has a sweetness and it has
805,2149.36,2151.36, a sharpness to it.
806,2151.36,2153.36," I have it in ice cream, I have it on fish,"
807,2153.36,2155.36, I have it everywhere.
808,2155.36,2157.36, I get spot on about the power of spices
809,2157.36,2159.36," to transform dishes, whether"
810,2159.36,2161.36, savory or sweet.
811,2161.36,2163.36, Here's my quick guide to the spices I use most.
812,2165.36,2167.36, Black pepper. This is the spice
813,2167.36,2169.36, I couldn't do without. Always buy a whole
814,2169.36,2171.36, and grind yourself so you get the freshest
815,2171.36,2173.36, flavour.
816,2173.36,2175.36, Cardamom. These pods come in green or black
817,2175.36,2177.36, types and have a fantastic
818,2177.36,2179.36, spicy sweet taste. Brilliant for
819,2179.36,2181.36, everything from curries to rice dishes
820,2181.36,2183.36, and puddings. Coriander.
821,2183.36,2185.36, These citrusy seeds are perfect
822,2185.36,2187.36, in pickles or grind to use in fragrance
823,2187.36,2189.36, stews and soups.
824,2189.36,2191.36, Cumin. A savory spice
825,2191.36,2193.36, that's pungent and nutty. It's great
826,2193.36,2195.36, in marinade with delicious
827,2195.36,2197.36, meat and fish.
828,2197.36,2199.36, Dense cinnamon. Sweetly fragrant
829,2199.36,2201.36, and great with apples or in cakes.
830,2201.36,2203.36, And nutmeg.
831,2203.36,2205.36, Warm and spicy. It's delicious in a
832,2205.36,2207.36, bestial sauce. Finally saffron.
833,2207.36,2209.36, These sweet strands infuse a brilliant
834,2209.36,2211.36, bright red colour and are great in
835,2211.36,2213.36, stews and soups. Finally saffron.
836,2213.36,2215.36, These sweet strands infuse a brilliant
837,2215.36,2217.36, red colour and are great in sourness
838,2217.36,2219.36, stews and even though it's more
839,2219.36,2221.36," expensive than gold, a pinch goes"
840,2221.36,2223.36," a long, long way."
841,2223.36,2225.36, Store your spices properly and
842,2225.36,2227.36, they'll last for years. You keep it
843,2227.36,2229.36, airtight in a tin or in a glass
844,2229.36,2231.36, jar in your cupboard.
845,2231.36,2233.36, Don't be scared of spices.
846,2233.36,2235.36, Like an aftershave or a perfume.
847,2235.36,2237.36, You have to select it yourself. It has
848,2237.36,2239.36, to fit in with your taste and
849,2239.36,2241.36, you have to find what you like and
850,2241.36,2243.36, spice up your cooking.
851,2243.36,2245.36," Like all chefs, I love the"
852,2245.36,2247.36, challenge of transforming classic
853,2247.36,2249.36, recipes. Giving them a new twist to
854,2249.36,2251.36, make them modern and vibrant.
855,2251.36,2253.36, To keep old dishes fresh and
856,2253.36,2255.36," exciting, it's great to get"
857,2255.36,2257.36, spicy.
858,2257.36,2259.36, My next recipe is a
859,2259.36,2261.36, time-honoured British
860,2261.36,2263.36, classic but with the addition of
861,2263.36,2265.36," spices, it's given a new lease of"
862,2265.36,2267.36, life. Fragrant spice rice pudding.
863,2267.36,2269.36, You don't have to cook
864,2269.36,2271.36, savoury dishes. Using
865,2271.36,2273.36, aromatics and spices across desserts
866,2273.36,2275.36, takes your puddings to a completely
867,2275.36,2277.36, different level.
868,2279.36,2281.36," First off, our spices."
869,2281.36,2283.36, This is a fresh vanilla pod.
870,2283.36,2285.36, Fragrant and
871,2285.36,2287.36, packed full of flavour. Use the
872,2287.36,2289.36, back of the knife and flatten it.
873,2289.36,2291.36, That removes all those little
874,2291.36,2293.36, seeds off the skin of
875,2293.36,2295.36," the vanilla pod. Take your knife,"
876,2295.36,2297.36, slice down the middle.
877,2297.36,2299.36," When you open that up, the smell"
878,2299.36,2301.36, is incredible. Take
879,2301.36,2303.36, the tip of the knife and you scrape
880,2303.36,2305.36, inside and look.
881,2305.36,2307.36, All those seeds
882,2307.36,2309.36, dying to come out. That
883,2309.36,2311.36, is incredible. There are thousands
884,2311.36,2313.36, of seeds still ingrained to the
885,2313.36,2315.36, pod. So put them
886,2315.36,2317.36, in the casserole. Cardamom.
887,2317.36,2319.36," Powerful, spicy."
888,2319.36,2321.36, Take two little pods.
889,2321.36,2323.36, Place your knife on top
890,2323.36,2325.36, and lightly crack them.
891,2325.36,2327.36, Crack in the cardamom pods. Helps
892,2327.36,2329.36, release all the amazing flavour.
893,2329.36,2331.36, Clothes. Give it that kind of
894,2331.36,2333.36, aniseed flavour
895,2333.36,2335.36, with a lot of depth.
896,2335.36,2337.36," One, two, three."
897,2337.36,2339.36, Cinnamon stick. Snap
898,2339.36,2341.36, and in.
899,2341.36,2343.36, Just smelling that level of fragrance.
900,2343.36,2345.36, You can imagine what the rice pudding is going to taste of.
901,2345.36,2347.36, Turn on the heat. Lightly toast
902,2347.36,2349.36, those spices just
903,2349.36,2351.36, a couple of seconds. What's going to happen
904,2351.36,2353.36, is it's going to sort of enhance
905,2353.36,2355.36, those spices in a way that it just draws out
906,2355.36,2357.36, an even more powerful fragrance.
907,2357.36,2359.36, Coconut milk in.
908,2361.36,2363.36, Sugar. Two tablespoons.
909,2367.36,2369.36, Milk.
910,2371.36,2373.36, And then a couple of tablespoons of cream.
911,2373.36,2375.36, Bring it slowly to the boil
912,2375.36,2377.36, to allow the flavours to infuse.
913,2377.36,2379.36, And this rice pudding reminds me of my time in India
914,2379.36,2381.36, where I got really into that chai tea
915,2381.36,2383.36, fragrance because it was just so
916,2383.36,2385.36, delicious
917,2385.36,2387.36, and so comforting.
918,2387.36,2389.36, Take a lime
919,2389.36,2391.36, in. The lime just cuts through the richness
920,2391.36,2393.36, of the coconut. Gives it that nice little bit of acidity.
921,2393.36,2395.36, Goes fantastically well with the
922,2395.36,2397.36, cinnamon and that fresh vanilla
923,2397.36,2399.36, nice. Have a taste.
924,2401.36,2403.36, Now let's come up to the boil
925,2403.36,2405.36, give it a nice little clean
926,2405.36,2407.36, around the outside
927,2407.36,2409.36, and in with the rice.
928,2409.36,2411.36, Use 200 grams of pudding rice
929,2411.36,2413.36, don't wash it beforehand because the starch
930,2413.36,2415.36, helps thicken the rice pudding in the oven
931,2415.36,2417.36, and just turn that down to a
932,2417.36,2419.36, light simmer. And the pudding rice starts
933,2419.36,2421.36, to open up and it absorbs all that coconut
934,2421.36,2423.36, vanilla
935,2423.36,2425.36," cardamom, clove"
936,2425.36,2427.36, and cinnamon. Bring up to the boil
937,2427.36,2429.36, gently and cook it out
938,2429.36,2431.36, for three to five minutes.
939,2431.36,2433.36, Boiling it rapidly the rice opens up
940,2433.36,2435.36, and it goes into mush. We want to keep that nice texture
941,2435.36,2437.36, and that sort of fragrant rice pudding
942,2437.36,2439.36, on a gentle simmer.
943,2441.36,2443.36," Next, a little luxury."
944,2443.36,2445.36, I want to show you how
945,2445.36,2447.36, I take this simple delicious aromatic
946,2447.36,2449.36, rice pudding to a completely different level.
947,2449.36,2451.36, Here's what I do. Take
948,2451.36,2453.36," two egg yolks, separate them"
949,2453.36,2455.36, and give that
950,2455.36,2457.36, a really nice whisk.
951,2457.36,2459.36, Mix.
952,2463.36,2465.36, Two nice tablespoons of mascarpone cheese.
953,2465.36,2467.36, Whisk that
954,2467.36,2469.36, into the egg yolks.
955,2475.36,2477.36, Just as nice and smooth.
956,2477.36,2479.36, It's almost like finishing the rice pudding
957,2479.36,2481.36, in a delicious custard. Turn off the gas.
958,2481.36,2483.36, Add that
959,2483.36,2485.36, into the rice pudding. What happens
960,2485.36,2487.36, it starts to enrich
961,2487.36,2489.36, and really thicken this rice pudding
962,2489.36,2491.36, and takes it to a completely different level.
963,2491.36,2493.36, The rice is still not cooked.
964,2493.36,2495.36, It's started to go nice and soft. You can just see
965,2495.36,2497.36, how it's opening up.
966,2497.36,2499.36," But look, it's like rich aromatic"
967,2499.36,2501.36, lava
968,2501.36,2503.36, bubbling away.
969,2503.36,2505.36," Finally, great more citrus zest."
970,2505.36,2507.36, The lime on top.
971,2507.36,2509.36," Roasted, caramelized"
972,2509.36,2511.36, lime zest. On top of the rice pudding
973,2511.36,2513.36, is phenomenal.
974,2513.36,2515.36, Then put it in the oven
975,2515.36,2517.36, for 15 minutes at 200 degrees
976,2517.36,2519.36, to finish cooking the rice
977,2519.36,2521.36, and develop the intensely aromatic flavors.
978,2525.36,2527.36, Look at that.
979,2527.36,2529.36, An incredibly fragrant
980,2529.36,2531.36, rice pudding. How beautiful does that look?
981,2531.36,2533.36, Spices are a brilliant way
982,2533.36,2535.36, of helping classic dishes come alive.
983,2535.36,2537.36," I'll guarantee you'll never, ever"
984,2537.36,2539.36, have had a rice pudding like this before.
985,2543.36,2545.36," Next, my tricks"
986,2545.36,2547.36, of the trade and kitchen tips.
987,2551.36,2553.36," First, how to zest a lemon."
988,2553.36,2555.36, The important part
989,2555.36,2557.36, is not to zest any of the piff.
990,2557.36,2559.36, Watch the following technique
991,2559.36,2561.36, and I'll show you how.
992,2561.36,2563.36, We've got these original graters. Really important
993,2563.36,2565.36," when we use this, we use the fine"
994,2565.36,2567.36, zester. Not the big
995,2567.36,2569.36," rough one, not the one for slicing"
996,2569.36,2571.36, and not the other one for grating.
997,2571.36,2573.36," Next, this little one here."
998,2573.36,2575.36," Onto a plate, because it's always easier"
999,2575.36,2577.36, to lift off from the plate than it is
1000,2577.36,2579.36, on the board. And the most important thing
1001,2579.36,2581.36, about zesting a lemon
1002,2581.36,2583.36, is nice long strokes
1003,2583.36,2585.36, but twisting
1004,2585.36,2587.36, the lemon round. Every time we go down
1005,2587.36,2589.36, we twist.
1006,2589.36,2591.36, Same with the orange and same with the
1007,2591.36,2593.36, lime.
1008,2595.36,2597.36, Little tap.
1009,2597.36,2599.36, If you go too far
1010,2599.36,2601.36, let me just show you
1011,2601.36,2603.36," look, you got that white bitter"
1012,2603.36,2605.36, piff that destroys
1013,2605.36,2607.36, the wonderful
1014,2607.36,2609.36, zesty flavour. And look
1015,2609.36,2611.36, that's what we're looking for there.
1016,2611.36,2613.36, This really nice vibrant lemon zest.
1017,2613.36,2615.36, Delicious.
1018,2615.36,2617.36, Garlic is a key ingredient
1019,2617.36,2619.36, in so many spicy dishes.
1020,2619.36,2621.36, My tip for finely chopping a mintsin
1021,2621.36,2623.36, is add a pinch of salt for abrasion
1022,2623.36,2625.36, which helps break the fibres of the garlic down
1023,2625.36,2627.36, for a much better result.
1024,2627.36,2629.36, For getting the most out root ginger
1025,2629.36,2631.36, simply remove the skin
1026,2631.36,2633.36, using a teaspoon. It's easier
1027,2633.36,2635.36, than using a knife and you can get around the tricky bits.
1028,2635.36,2637.36, Or just keep the skin on
1029,2637.36,2639.36, and give it a good wash.
1030,2641.36,2643.36, Never throw out vanilla
1031,2643.36,2645.36, pots. There's a ton of flavour
1032,2645.36,2647.36, left in the skin. Stick inside jars
1033,2647.36,2649.36, of sugar and leave to infuse.
1034,2649.36,2651.36," Great to sprinkle on cakes, biscuits or porridge."
1035,2653.36,2655.36," When grinding up spices,"
1036,2655.36,2657.36, you can have any leftover. You can store it
1037,2657.36,2659.36, in an airtight jar for up to two months.
1038,2659.36,2661.36, Great for a spicy kick to have at your fingertips.
