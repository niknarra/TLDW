0,0.0,4.04, Here's some video with the iPhone 15.
1,4.04,7.76, It's just on the base lens.
2,7.76,9.68," Overall, it looks pretty good."
3,9.68,17.72, What do you guys think?
4,17.72,21.68, iPhone 15 honest review after one month.
5,21.68,28.68," So in just two days, it'll be one month since the iPhone 15 went live on September 22nd."
6,28.68,33.56, Now I want to share with you my honest review of this particular base model phone here in
7,33.56,34.56, this video.
8,34.56,36.76, We'll begin by talking about the price point.
9,36.76,42.84, So Apple has launched this phone at around $799 or $829 if you're buying it on lock.
10,42.84,47.72, So it's basically the same exact price as the iPhone 14.
11,47.72,51.120000000000005," Now right off the bat, I want to say that I really think this is a better value than"
12,51.120000000000005,55.4," that phone, mostly because the back feels more smooth and nice."
13,55.4,61.879999999999995," It's not as smudgy, dynamic island on board, USB-C, slightly thinner bezels."
14,61.879999999999995,67.24," The phone itself just feels like it was a better deal, a better value than the iPhone"
15,67.24,68.24, 14.
16,68.24,72.32," So price, I think they're giving you quite a lot for the price."
17,72.32,75.48," Sans the 60 Hertz display, so or Sans 120 Hertz."
18,75.48,80.75999999999999," So we have a 60 Hertz display on board, which is, it's kind of eh right now."
19,80.75999999999999,84.7, I really hope Apple goes to a 90 or 120 next year.
20,84.7,88.32000000000001," So when speaking about the design, we still had the silent switch right there."
21,88.32000000000001,89.64, Volume markers on the left.
22,89.64,94.68," USB-C on the bottom, persistently drilled microphone and speaker holes."
23,94.68,96.56, You'll see torque screws right there.
24,96.56,98.96000000000001," On the right side, 5G antenna."
25,98.96000000000001,103.36," And we'll see right there a power button, dual camera on the rear, 48 megapixel plus"
26,103.36,104.36, 12.
27,104.36,111.08," Overall, a really smooth, thin, light, comfortable, 6.1 inch iPhone."
28,111.08,113.32000000000001, This thing feels great in the hand.
29,113.32,116.86," It's definitely the every man iPhone, the every person iPhone."
30,116.86,120.25999999999999," I think no matter what your hand size is, you can probably get by with this."
31,120.25999999999999,124.74," If you have smaller hands, this will feel pretty big, but it's not going to feel massive."
32,124.74,125.82, It's lightweight.
33,125.82,130.74," This is the standard right here, the gold standard, the base standard iPhone."
34,130.74,136.85999999999999," And I think the design is, while not a massive leap forward, it's a nice jump, especially"
35,136.85999999999999,139.54," with Dynamic Island, bringing it to the modern era."
36,139.54,143.07999999999998," And over the past 30 days, I just feel like it's a great phone to hold."
37,143.07999999999998,148.44," It feels very comfortable, easy to pocket, easy to place, pretty much anywhere."
38,148.44,150.12, It is a little bit slippery though.
39,150.12,152.64, It feels like it could slip out of the hand a little bit.
40,152.64,157.48, I would probably put a case if you're worried about cracking that matte textured glass back.
41,157.48,162.0," And the colors, these lighter color pastel colors, I don't know if people really like"
42,162.0,163.0, Dig D's.
43,163.0,167.28," Let me bring the exposure, hold on, let me bring it down a little bit so you can see"
44,167.28,168.28, what I'm talking about.
45,168.58,174.18, These lighter colors right here definitely kind of lend to more of a white look on these
46,174.18,175.18, phones.
47,175.18,178.62," So if you like a darker color, you might want to consider the matte black."
48,178.62,182.1," I would say build quality wise though, IP68 of course on here."
49,182.1,186.1," It feels slightly less durable than the 13, the 11."
50,186.1,187.1, Those phones feel like tanks.
51,187.1,191.54," This is feeling a little bit lighter, slightly more fragile to me."
52,191.54,193.22, Doesn't necessarily mean it is more fragile.
53,193.22,195.3, It just kind of feels that way.
54,195.3,197.5, My wife actually picked this up compared to the 13.
55,197.52,199.4, She said it feels cheaper.
56,199.4,201.44, Some people are going to find this to feel cheaper.
57,201.44,202.8, I personally think it feels better.
58,202.8,205.8, I think it feels more polished or fined.
59,205.8,209.08, You don't have the shinier back anymore.
60,209.08,211.4, Some people might think that feels a little cheaper.
61,211.4,215.36," All in all, I think it feels way better and I like that it is pretty much clean in every"
62,215.36,216.36, respect.
63,216.36,220.16, This is a phone that can go through the day to day and never really look that dirty.
64,220.16,225.76, You got to be really dirty with whatever you are doing with your hands or whatever to really
65,225.85999999999999,228.29999999999998, get this thing nasty.
66,228.29999999999998,232.1," You got to be eating some french fries with some ketchup, getting the grease all over"
67,232.1,234.89999999999998," there, getting the oil all over the phone."
68,234.89999999999998,240.06," Playing, doing mechanic work, getting your hands dirty and then touching it."
69,240.06,243.94, It is not super easy to get this phone dirty with just daily use.
70,243.94,250.34," A very clean build quality overall, just slightly more fragile feeling I feel like."
71,250.34,254.34, That is probably due to the lighter weight and due to this back feel.
72,254.92000000000002,258.92, Just a feel a little bit less like a tank than the other phones.
73,258.92,261.42," It is probably due to the lighter weight, it is probably just my perception."
74,261.42,263.04, Let me know your thoughts down below.
75,263.04,265.8, I did install a screen protector on this phone.
76,265.8,269.96, I have been rocking it a case because I am not going to buy an $800 phone and take it
77,269.96,275.28000000000003, outside by the cement and pretend like I got apple care because I didn't buy apple care
78,275.28000000000003,276.28000000000003, for this.
79,276.28000000000003,278.72," So no, I am going to rock it with a case."
80,278.86,283.86," Albeit I do use a very thin, very thin, you know, clear case."
81,283.86,285.66, I don't really like anything else.
82,285.66,288.82000000000005, I just want to see the color of the phone and what I picked up.
83,288.82000000000005,291.90000000000003," Alright, so moving on to display quality."
84,291.90000000000003,293.46000000000004, So we have an OLED display here.
85,293.46000000000004,295.42," Again, bezels are quite thin."
86,295.42,297.82000000000005, They are not as thin as 15 Pro or Pro Max.
87,297.82000000000005,302.5," So if you want that really close to the all screen look, you want the Pro or Pro Max."
88,302.5,307.98," However, Dynamic Island really brings this phone to like a pro level in terms of iPhones."
89,307.98,312.20000000000005, It brings it to looking like the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max.
90,312.20000000000005,314.36, But it has really good accuracy.
91,314.36,318.40000000000003, Nowhere near as vibrant as something like the Galaxy series.
92,318.40000000000003,322.8," So if you're looking for a vibrant display, you're going to get a more natural look here"
93,322.8,325.44," for the iPhone 15, which to me is great."
94,325.44,330.84000000000003," I mean, day to day, I don't need something seringly vibrant in my eyes day to day."
95,330.84000000000003,334.64000000000004," But if you're into consuming media, you're going to want that vibrancy from a Samsung"
96,334.64000000000004,335.64000000000004, phone.
97,335.64,341.21999999999997," I prefer Samsung phones for watching movies and videos, but for day to day stuff and regular"
98,341.21999999999997,345.14," usage, I like the natural look that the iPhone 15 employs."
99,345.14,348.86," And so while it's still 60 Hertz, you have to pay attention."
100,348.86,351.74," After a couple of days, I don't really think you think about this too much."
101,351.74,355.3," And of course, you have your dark modes, your true tone, your night shifts on here."
102,355.3,357.3, You don't really think about it much after a couple of days.
103,357.3,361.46, And if you're not comparing it to other phones or looking at videos where they show that
104,361.46,362.46, difference.
105,362.46,364.94," However, this is not an excuse I'm making for Apple."
106,364.96,367.16, I'm just saying this is my experience.
107,367.16,370.48, I do think Apple still needs to be called out for this.
108,370.48,374.32," And you know, there's phones that are cheaper than this, giving you a smoother refresh."
109,374.32,378.08," Come on, Apple, please just put a 90 Hertz or a 120 Hertz."
110,378.08,384.15999999999997, I think the customers paying 829 plus or even over 1000 with taxes for the 15 plus deserve
111,384.15999999999997,387.24, a 90 or a 120 Hertz display.
112,387.24,390.88," Honestly, they do even if you go 10 Hertz to 120 Hertz and keep the one Hertz to the"
113,390.9,395.62, 120 Hertz for the pro max or even do a 90 Hertz to keep that separated.
114,395.62,396.62, That's fine.
115,396.62,397.9, But let's get a smoother display on here.
116,397.9,398.9, Okay.
117,398.9,400.3, So the experience with dynamic Island.
118,400.3,404.5," So you plug it in the charge, you'll see a charging."
119,404.5,411.65999999999997," Also if you you order things like Uber eats, you have a Uber coming, a lift ride."
120,411.65999999999997,413.46, Also face ID shows up there.
121,413.46,416.18," You hit the, I think the flashlight works on here."
122,416.18,417.18, Yeah.
123,417.18,418.18, Not yet.
124,418.18,419.58, I don't see it up there right now.
125,419.58,421.32, The ringer works up there.
126,421.32,426.47999999999996," So there's a lot of little things that the software does when somebody calls you, it"
127,426.47999999999996,427.47999999999996, expands.
128,427.47999999999996,433.12," So the dynamic Island experience is while it's a big blotch on the display, I really"
129,433.12,436.0, like an uninterrupted display experience.
130,436.0,440.29999999999995," While it's here and why we don't have the technology to get the high quality, all screen"
131,440.29999999999995,444.4," display without some, you know, weak under display camera."
132,444.4,445.91999999999996," This is a nice solution, I think."
133,445.92,449.7, I think it gives you something that lets people know this is the iPhone 15.
134,449.7,454.3," And secondly, it gives you the experience of, you know, using applications with software."
135,454.3,457.22, So a lot of people are enjoying how dynamic Island works.
136,457.22,460.02000000000004, And it's nice that you don't have to go to the pro to experience this now.
137,460.02000000000004,466.02000000000004, So the software experience with the iPhone 15 doesn't really change at all from the iPhone
138,466.02000000000004,468.5, 15 plus that I covered earlier.
139,468.5,469.86, It's basically the same.
140,469.86,475.3," However, being the smaller iPhone, you cannot, you know, kind of turn into landscape."
141,475.3,478.40000000000003," You go here, it's not going to do anything right there."
142,478.40000000000003,480.96000000000004," And if you go into the messages, it's not going to do anything."
143,480.96000000000004,483.16, It's mostly a portrait based phone here.
144,483.16,484.32, Hit the formats.
145,484.32,486.48, You'll see there's this new software feature.
146,486.48,488.92," Well, it's basically hardware, but they put in the software."
147,488.92,492.76, You have the ability to use a 24 megapixel shot.
148,492.76,494.64, And then there's not much else.
149,494.64,499.52," I mean, it's pretty similar to iPhone 14."
150,499.52,502.40000000000003, But I do like this two time zoom.
151,502.40000000000003,503.40000000000003, That's a big deal in software.
152,503.4,505.7, We'll talk about that in the camera department.
153,505.7,507.41999999999996, You have your app library here.
154,507.41999999999996,509.73999999999995, You have your control center over here.
155,509.73999999999995,513.78, Tons of accessibility features as you'll find in every iPhone.
156,513.78,517.42," Still in iOS, you'll see we do have a lot of applications down here."
157,517.42,518.42, Nothing.
158,518.42,520.42, They should just put that in a section that says apps.
159,520.42,522.66, I don't know why I don't do that already.
160,522.66,526.98," And then if you go here to accessibility, I think iOS has some of the best accessibility"
161,526.98,529.42, features in the game today.
162,529.42,530.42, Really cool.
163,530.42,532.02, Hold this button right here for Siri.
164,532.02,535.12," You can also say, hey, Siri, and that will pop up."
165,535.12,536.24," Well, I didn't do it right now."
166,536.24,538.4399999999999, But sorry if I triggered yours.
167,538.4399999999999,541.52," And then you'll see over here, you can add widgets."
168,541.52,543.12, Just go like that.
169,543.12,544.68," I mean, grid of icons."
170,544.68,550.16, You can customize it with some customizable launcher things like customization.
171,550.16,553.3199999999999, You could just type in customization.
172,553.3199999999999,556.4, And there'll be different ways you can customize it.
173,556.4,559.04," It's going to take some time, but there's some theme packs and stuff like that."
174,559.04,562.0999999999999, So there is some customization you could do on this phone.
175,562.0999999999999,564.14," Overall, the updates come in regularly."
176,564.14,566.6999999999999, You're going to get about five or six years of updates.
177,566.6999999999999,570.14," Just a very simple, great day-to-day experience."
178,570.14,572.78, Very secure privacy is on point.
179,572.78,576.38, One thing I like about iPhones is that they really feel like you're not seeing too many
180,576.38,580.62, ads throughout the system or just a little more private to use.
181,580.62,582.0999999999999, I really like that.
182,582.0999999999999,584.5, So software very good on this phone.
183,584.5,585.5, That's one of the main draws.
184,585.5,589.02," If it didn't have iOS, this phone would not sell super well, I feel like."
185,589.02,591.48, So how does all that software translate to performance?
186,591.48,596.24," Well we are using the, this is the A16 Bionic chip set."
187,596.24,600.48, So this is last year's chip from iPhone 14 Pro.
188,600.48,606.04," And all the way throughout the year, I covered that phone extensively multiple times, angered"
189,606.04,611.16," some people and entertained some people, did tons of speed tests."
190,611.16,614.36," It was like the benchmark phone, which I compared everything to."
191,614.36,616.92, And now this phone has that chip.
192,616.92,618.36, Never really had an issue with that.
193,618.42,621.98," The A17 Pro chip is just a better chip, but did I need it?"
194,621.98,622.98, Nope.
195,622.98,626.42, I just got it because it's on my 15 Pro Max.
196,626.42,630.62, What that means is that you have zero issue with performance here.
197,630.62,633.74, 15 is one of the fastest chips out there.
198,633.74,638.78, It's even faster than some competing Android devices that cost more than this.
199,638.78,642.1," Like the Pixel 8 Pro, which has a G3 chip."
200,642.1,644.4200000000001, This chip in here is faster than that.
201,644.4799999999999,650.56," It doesn't have the same price tag, or it doesn't have the amount of RAM that that phone"
202,650.56,651.56, has.
203,651.56,656.12," Even with 6GB of RAM, this phone is plenty quick day to day."
204,656.12,659.4599999999999," That's one of the things that can make this still fast, even though they don't put 120"
205,659.4599999999999,660.4599999999999, Hertz.
206,660.4599999999999,661.4599999999999, Let's talk about those cameras.
207,661.4599999999999,664.9599999999999, 48 megapixel main and then a 12 megapixel ultra wide.
208,664.9599999999999,668.64," If we go ahead and punch in 2x zoom, we'll almost drop that phone."
209,668.64,670.7199999999999, That's that slippery stuff I was talking about.
210,670.7199999999999,673.76, It has a really nice focal length of 2x.
211,674.1,675.34, That's really pretty good.
212,675.34,677.42, I think that's like 52mm.
213,677.42,679.74, That's pretty good focal length.
214,679.74,680.74, I really like that.
215,680.74,685.02," It's kind of like the one we used to have on the iPhone 7 plus, 8 plus those days."
216,685.02,686.02, iPhone 10.
217,686.02,687.02, Those are great.
218,687.02,691.5," This goes 10x zoom now as well, so very similar to an iPhone 10."
219,691.5,697.8199999999999, Much better quality because of all the AI and stuff that's built in these days.
220,697.8199999999999,701.18," I finally feel like after using this phone, you also got that portrait mode where you"
221,701.18,704.68," can change, you can just take a photo and then after the fact, you can hit the portrait"
222,704.68,709.4799999999999," thing without having to go to the portrait and remember, ah man, I wanted to take a portrait."
223,709.4799999999999,711.0799999999999, Video quality of course very good.
224,711.0799999999999,712.0799999999999, 4K 60.
225,712.0799999999999,713.4399999999999, We're still not at 8K or nothing like that.
226,713.4399999999999,717.4," I don't think we need 8K at this point, but you got cinematic video."
227,717.4,722.3599999999999, This feels like nearly a pro phone without being called a pro phone.
228,722.3599999999999,726.76," I took plenty of photos and honestly, I think now more than ever, the regular models are"
229,726.76,730.88," making more of a case for themselves in the sense that getting the focus maybe, they're"
230,730.9399999999999,735.62," making more of a sense, they're making more of a case to buy these, to make it more sense"
231,735.62,740.18, to buy these over like the 14 or 15 pro and pro max if you really want the lightweight
232,740.18,745.5," and if you're not a serious camera user because even if you are kind of a serious camera user,"
233,745.5,750.66," you still have plenty of good software here and a really good camera that you know, would"
234,750.66,752.9399999999999, rival some older pro phones.
235,752.9399999999999,755.02, So check out my samples.
236,755.02,756.02, Let me know your thoughts.
237,756.02,760.56, I'm going to say I'm really impressed with the dual camera setup on the base 15 and 15
238,760.56,761.06, plus.
239,906.02,911.66, The battery life has been pretty darn good as well.
240,911.66,915.92," I mean, this is a full day phone provided that you're not, you know, heavy using the"
241,915.92,922.5799999999999, camera video quality video shooting or provided you're not playing top level gaming titles
242,922.5799999999999,923.5799999999999, all day.
243,923.5799999999999,925.14, This one is an all day phone.
244,925.14,926.96, It's still one that I would charge every night.
245,926.96,931.8199999999999, This is no max phone that I can go into the next day and probably get through most of
246,931.8199999999999,933.06, the morning.
247,933.0999999999999,937.26," This one I'm down about 20-ish percent, 30-ish percent at night time."
248,937.26,939.0999999999999, So I'm feeling a little concerned.
249,939.0999999999999,941.4599999999999, I want to charge this every night.
250,941.4599999999999,946.9799999999999," Other than that, about seven or so hours of screen time is pretty substantial for this"
251,946.9799999999999,948.9399999999999, phone sometimes in the six hour range.
252,948.9399999999999,952.3399999999999," But you know, some people are going to get even more depending on, I mean, I'm blasting"
253,952.3399999999999,953.3399999999999, the brightness.
254,953.3399999999999,954.3399999999999, I'm using camera.
255,954.3399999999999,957.42, So don't expect me to get nine hours with this phone.
256,957.42,958.9, Battery life has been solid.
257,958.9,961.78, USB-C charging on here is a two point O variety.
258,961.78,966.4599999999999," So it's not the fastest and it doesn't transfer the fastest, but it's still USB-C."
259,966.4599999999999,971.1, And it's a very convenient thing if you have a lot of other USB-C tech products in your
260,971.1,972.1, life.
261,972.1,974.5799999999999," If you don't, it's going to be a little bit of a headache at first, but you'll get used"
262,974.5799999999999,978.34, to it and then you'll probably kind of just adapt and everything will be USB-C anyway
263,978.34,979.5, in the future.
264,979.5,981.5799999999999, So this really future-proofs this phone as well.
265,981.5799999999999,986.54," One month later, the audio performance has been pretty darn good on this phone."
266,986.54,991.42," Having plenty of loud, it's plenty crispy, but it doesn't sound quite like a pro or"
267,991.42,992.66, pro max phone.
268,992.66,996.5, The audio speakers are just not that good as the pro models.
269,996.5,998.6999999999999, So keep that in mind.
270,998.6999999999999,1003.3," If you really care about listening music from your phone, you probably want a pro phone."
271,1003.3,1006.98," If you like to connect to Bluetooth, this has got very fast standards."
272,1006.98,1010.66," In addition, the call quality reception strength has been better than ever."
273,1010.66,1015.54, I remember reviewing the iPhone 11 a few years ago and just having terrible bars strength
274,1015.54,1017.0999999999999, when I go out and about.
275,1017.0999999999999,1022.62, I've even had drop calls back when they were using the Intel modems these days.
276,1022.62,1024.3799999999999, Pretty darn good in this respect as well.
277,1024.3799999999999,1025.82, Couple other advantages.
278,1025.82,1029.46," You have the emergency SOS features on boards, satellite."
279,1029.46,1035.1399999999999," You mean features like the resell advantage, the iPhone 15 one that you way more money"
280,1035.1399999999999,1041.46, back when you go to head and trade this versus like something like a galaxy S 23 unless you
281,1041.46,1047.14," trade the Samsung or maybe even a like pixel, you know, eight, a regular model."
282,1047.14,1050.98, These phones drop in value much faster than iPhone 15.
283,1050.98,1055.3, So this phone right here really does have quite a few advantages even if it has that
284,1055.3,1056.54, weaker 60 Hertz panel.
285,1056.54,1060.9, And I forgot to mention that this actually has the same pixels per inch and brightness
286,1060.9,1063.38, as the pro.
287,1063.38,1067.7," So again, making a cell a case for itself with the higher brightness display."
288,1067.7,1069.94, Now I'm not going to say this thing is perfect.
289,1069.94,1070.94, What are the cons?
290,1070.94,1072.26, No split screen.
291,1072.26,1075.3, You could split screen on every Samsung phone this size.
292,1075.3,1076.54, Still no split screen.
293,1076.54,1079.42, That makes it weaker than the competition there.
294,1079.42,1086.3400000000001, You can also get a better zoom on a lot of phones in this at a cheaper price or the same
295,1086.3400000000001,1087.46, price.
296,1087.46,1093.3," You can also get way more features on competing phones, better screens like in terms of 120"
297,1093.3,1098.46," Hertz, maybe more vibrant, bigger, much bigger for the price."
298,1098.46,1102.66," But everything else I said, this is still a great option for you."
299,1102.66,1103.66, Conclusion.
300,1103.66,1107.54, You got the ecosystem advantage of Apple if you're into that.
301,1107.54,1113.22," It's probably the best base model upgrade since the 11 model, since the 11 to the 12."
302,1113.22,1118.7, Remember when they changed from the iPhone 11 to the 12 and it was a bigger feeling change?
303,1118.7,1121.22, I think we have that again this year.
304,1121.22,1122.22, It's a very felt change.
305,1122.22,1125.58, It brings enough changes that I think even some people that were considering Pros and
306,1125.58,1131.86," Pro Max's would consider the base devices, the 15 and 15 Plus."
307,1131.86,1135.1399999999999," But if you really crave a smoother refresh, either wait until next year or go with the"
308,1135.1399999999999,1137.22," Pro, then that's it for me."
309,1137.22,1138.62, There's nothing else to say about it.
310,1138.62,1140.54, It's a good iPhone.
311,1140.54,1141.54, Is it groundbreaking?
312,1141.54,1146.6999999999998," No, but does it improve upon everything that we wanted to see Apple improve upon?"
313,1146.6999999999998,1149.02, Pretty much except for we don't have a ProMotion display.
314,1149.02,1150.82, Thumbs up if you enjoyed it.
