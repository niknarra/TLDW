0,0.0,5.44," We've done many a pizza on this channel. Some of the most legendary, but today we're making the king of all pizzas"
1,19.2,22.64," Okay, so today we're making Neapolitan pizza instead of just doing that"
2,22.64,27.04," I thought well, let's take two traditional pizzas put them together and see if there's a true winner"
3,27.04,32.8," It's gonna be a traditional Neapolitan pizza margarita and a traditional Roman pizza. There are many kinds, but one specific kind"
4,33.92,39.36," When it comes to a proper Italian pizza, there is no corner cutting because if you cut the corner then the Italians"
5,39.6,45.92, They cut you they're probably watching right now thinking like what's he gonna do better than suck this up that presents a major challenge
6,45.92,49.68," How do you do it at home? Is it even possible? And that's where today's sponsor, uni comes in"
7,49.84,54.0, If you're at all into the cooking space and you watch cooking channels or you're into food or whatever
8,54.0,58.0, There's I don't see how it's even physically possible that you've never heard of an uni pizza oven
9,58.24,62.480000000000004, It is the answer to all of your home pizza oven questions you've ever had
10,62.72,66.16," I know this is sponsored, but I've cooked in a lot of different ovens in my career"
11,66.24,70.72, And all I have to say is this is genuinely the best home pizza oven
12,71.03999999999999,75.92, That's not like gigantic in a massive dome that takes up like 500 square feet of space
13,76.24000000000001,82.8, That makes the most beautiful perfectly cooked Neapolitan pizza I've ever had and it goes beyond that you can cook vegetables and all sorts of things in it
14,82.8,87.36," But today we're talking about Neapolitan pizza. So with all that said, let's make this shall we?"
15,87.6,93.6," Okay, we're gonna keep this a clean organized firm yet delicate fight. Not sure if that's even possible"
16,93.67999999999999,99.19999999999999, So we have two Italian pizzas here a classic Neapolitan pizza done as close to tradition as physically possible
17,99.28,104.56," But within the home in a roman style pizza, but wait not just any roman pizza"
18,105.2,107.2, specifically pizza out
19,107.36,110.8," Italians, how is that? Huh pretty good. You get a rating very nice"
20,111.03999999999999,116.39999999999999, Either we have smiling Italians or they're already in the comments yelling at me. Thank you. Let's begin with my personal favorite
21,116.47999999999999,121.44, Neapolitan. I need everyone to just take a step back and listen up brother. There are rules here
22,121.52,127.19999999999999, Let us consult the holy book the pizza number one the sauce must contain san marzano tomatoes
23,127.44,130.0, number two the flour must be type zero or
24,130.56,135.36, 00 number three it must be cooked within 60 to 90 seconds at around 800 Fahrenheit
25,135.44,137.44, Let it be known that this isn't even close to all the rules
26,137.44,139.52, But we also don't have our entire lives to write them all out
27,139.6,144.16, But we're going to stick as close as possible to these rules while at home. So first let's start with our dough
28,144.24,148.0, Which is the foundation here sort of with 512 grams of filtered water
29,148.07999999999998,151.52, He did exactly to 95 Fahrenheit and you see how I said exact. I mean
30,152.0,152.64, exact
31,152.64,154.64, Papa no geese if you don't keep
32,154.96,156.24, exact numbers
33,156.24,160.64, So to your water you're gonna add three to four grams of instant yeast if it's more warm and humid in your area
34,160.64,162.24, Then go with the lower number in yeast
35,162.32000000000002,167.28, So that together and let that sit for five minutes then in a large bowl add 800 grams of double o tippo flour
36,167.36,173.04000000000002, Followed by 16 grams of fine sea salt mix that together with the flour until incorporated until your flour add all of your water
37,173.20000000000002,175.20000000000002, And mix by hand. Hmm
38,175.20000000000002,179.68," Yes, you want to touch the dough to create the connection of human and pizza"
39,180.08,185.52, Mix that just until a shaggy dough forms and the flour is fully hydrated cover with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature
40,185.60000000000002,190.48000000000002, For 20 minutes from there you'll remove your dough from the bowl place it on a work surface and give it some good old
41,190.48,192.48, slap
42,192.56,193.67999999999998, Folds
43,193.67999999999998,195.2," Oh, you don't know what slap unfolding is"
44,195.35999999999999,197.76, It's actually exactly what it sounds like you pick the dough up
45,197.92,200.88, You slap the bottom of it down then throw and fold it over itself
46,200.88,204.72, Then repeat that by picking it up not from the sides but actually front to back like this
47,204.95999999999998,208.95999999999998, And then repeat the slap and fold motion for about one to two minutes or until the dough starts to turn smooth
48,209.04,211.76, Transfer that back to your bowl and rest for 15 more minutes
49,211.92,216.64, Then you guessed it brother once again slap and fold for one to two more minutes or until the dough is very
50,217.04,218.0, supple
51,218.88,222.96, And hardly sticks to the counter roll it into a top ball grease your bowl with extra virgin olive oil
52,223.04,226.0, And place it back into the bowl cover completely with plastic wrap
53,226.08,230.16, And I mean if you're neurotic like me then really you want to cater wrap this mother f***er
54,230.32,234.8, Now place in the refrigerator for your dough son to have a beautiful slumber for 14 to 18 hours
55,235.04,237.6, This is essential in developing additional flavor in the dough
56,237.68,243.12, But could transversely be done at room temp in about four to six hours once your little man has had a good night's rest
57,243.2,247.84, Give him a kiss then punch all of the air out of him leaving him deflated and ready to shape into what you desire
58,247.84,252.8, Not what he desires just kidding. His life goal is to become a neapolitan pizza to keep things exact
59,252.88,255.28, You're then going to divide your dough into five even pieces
60,255.36,261.28000000000003, Which should be really about 250 grams each then squish out any excess air fold the sides to the middle flip it
61,261.36,266.4, So it seems side down and then roll it in circles on the counter keeping constant contact with the counter until you get a
62,266.48,268.08, medium toy ball
63,268.08,273.04, Place that into a proofing box or rimmed baking sheet that's dusted with flour and repeat with all of your pieces of dough
64,273.12,277.44, Be sure to leave at least one and a half inches of space in between each ball to account for spreading when they
65,279.76000000000005,284.48, Cover that with its lid or another inverted rimmed baking sheet and let that proof at room temp for three to four hours
66,284.56,289.20000000000005, Or until they're easy to stretch and maneuver and very lightly puffed while those are proofing
67,289.28000000000003,290.88, Let's quickly make our sauce very simply
68,290.88,295.68, You'll need one 24 ounce can of proper peeled san marzano tomatoes or fresh ones if you can get them
69,295.92,301.12, Blast if you can take them out of the can and lightly squeeze out their excess water out over sieve set in a bowl
70,301.2,302.48, Add all of your flesh
71,302.48,309.36," Uh, that's tomato flesh to a food processor along with two cloves of garlic and two and a half tablespoons or 35 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil"
72,309.52,315.04, Process that until extremely smooth season your taste with salt in an optional light pinch of sugar to mellow the acidity blend that in
73,315.12,321.6, Then just pass through a fine mesh sieve or chinois really be sure to push out as much of the pulp as you can leaving only the seeds behind
74,321.68,325.52," Otherwise, you'll just have tomato water. Then there you go. That's your fresh tomato sauce for the cheese"
75,325.68,327.12, You just need buffalo mozzarella
76,327.12,332.64, But if you want to get specific anything from campania will likely be ideal and if it's super
77,333.04,337.68, moist then drain it on a paper towel to you know get that moistness to calm down brother
78,337.76,342.8," All right before you shape your pizza, you're gonna preheat your pizza oven here. I'm using the brand new unikaru 16"
79,342.8,343.84000000000003, Pick your fuel of choice
80,343.84000000000003,348.32, You want to do whole wood then pop in your wood light up and let her rip you want charcoal cool
81,348.4,351.12, Toss those bad boys in and let hellfire rain down upon it
82,351.12,352.48, Or if you want to be mr
83,352.56,355.52000000000004, Scientist and fully control the temperature to connect it to a big
84,357.68,361.36, Propane tank and get it pumping whichever fuel option you want is up to you
85,361.36,367.04, But whatever you do just let it preheat for 15 minutes until it reaches 800 to 850 degrees fahrenheit
86,367.12,372.16," Yes, it's that quick and the chances of you getting that in a home oven is virtually impossible"
87,372.88,377.92," Unless you develop some kind of rig that allows it to reach a temperature like that, but i'm pretty sure if you do that"
88,378.40000000000003,381.2, The flame i should want to never come to see you
89,381.92,387.52000000000004, Now once your oven is piping hot snag a dough round and place it on a generously floured pizza peel flower the top of your
90,387.52000000000004,391.84000000000003, Round and then using your fist punch it down leaving a very thin border that's slightly thicker than the rest
91,391.92,395.52000000000004," Then once you're done, drape the dough over closed fists and stretch and turn by hand"
92,395.6,400.88, Repeatedly until you get about a 10 to 12 inch circle from there top it with just a couple tablespoons of refreshed tomato sauce
93,401.04,406.24, Spread it around evenly followed by a few pieces of torn mozzarella and a few leaves of basil. All right here they come
94,406.48,408.48," Oh, jessi can't cook the pizza"
95,408.56,412.40000000000003, Shut up. I've seen it done both ways literally in italy and you can debate all you want in the comments
96,412.40000000000003,415.52, But this pizza cooks in 90 seconds or less and the flavor can still contribute greatly
97,415.6,421.04," But if you're that worried you can always add it at the end for the freshness of its own flavor. It's basil. Okay, relax"
98,421.28000000000003,426.64, From there carefully open up your ooni slide it in close the door and let it cook for 30 to 45 seconds or till puffed
99,426.72,432.56, And one side starts to get some char then quickly turn it 180 degrees close the door and let it cook for another 30 to 45 seconds
100,432.64,435.04, For an evenly lightly charred pizza to emerge
101,435.44,440.4, Steaming and gleaming once you've pulled it out hit it with a light drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and optionally a light
102,440.48,444.16, Sprinkle of flaky salt and fresh cracked black pepper and that is your pizza
103,444.4,448.96, Simply repeat with the rest of your dough and now you can enjoy the most beautifully blistered puffy and
104,449.36,454.88, Luxuriously aerated pizza so good that angels will sing cry just for you in that pizza
105,455.04,456.08," Okay, we got that out of the way"
106,456.16,458.64, So now we just need to worry about mr. Roman
107,458.8,465.28, Surprisingly easier start with 432 grams of warm water around 95 fahrenheit and whisk in 7 grams of instant yeast
108,465.36,469.03999999999996, Place it to the side then in a large bowl mix together 600 grams of bread flour
109,469.03999999999996,473.2," You can do double o tippo, but bread flour actually works better here and 12 grams of fine sea salt"
110,473.2,477.52, Now once your yeast is bloomed whisk in two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil
111,477.68,479.44, And then pour all of that into your flour mix
112,479.59999999999997,484.96, Then it's the exact same mixing method as before mix by hand till just shaggy cover and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes
113,485.03999999999996,488.0, By the way resting period important. Don't try and skip it. Papa. No keys
114,488.0,491.28, All right. Anyway slap and fold rest 15 minutes slap and fold again
115,491.36,495.12, Then cover and place in the fridge for 14 to 18 hours. See what I'm saying? It's easy
116,495.2,499.28, The next day get yourself a good old-fashioned baking sheet coat it generously with olive oil
117,499.36,504.24," Then dump your dough which has been degassed not like farted, but you know you punch it punch it down"
118,504.32,509.12, That's degassing. Anyway gently spread it out as close to the edges as you can it will resist a little bit
119,509.2,515.6, Just keep trying it'll get there cover that with another inverted baking sheet wrap tightly with plastic wrap and proof at room temperature for two hours
120,515.76,517.84, Now while that's proofing let's make our sauce and toppings
121,517.9200000000001,522.4, Oh also preheat your oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit because it's gonna take some time to get hot hot
122,522.5600000000001,528.48, Who's this donkey for the sauce you're gonna add two ounces or 56 grams of diced pancetta full of a tablespoon or so of
123,528.5600000000001,530.88, Olive oil in a medium saucepan heat that over medium heat
124,530.88,534.5600000000001, There's a lot of heating and mediums going on right now once that starts to render its fat out
125,534.64,538.64, Let it cook stirring occasionally for about two to four minutes or until your pancetta is brown and
126,538.96,539.76, Gwip
127,539.76,544.5600000000001, Then add four cloves of thinly sliced garlic saute that for about a minute or until toasted and golden brown
128,544.7199999999999,548.56," Optionally, you can toss in a teaspoon of red chili flakes if you need a little bit of spice"
129,549.1199999999999,552.64, Soothe it in and let that toast then add in one 24 ounce can of crushed
130,552.88,558.3199999999999, Sandmarzano tomatoes stir that together bring to a boil then lower the heat to uh low and let that simmer for five minutes
131,558.4,562.8, Or until slightly reduced season it taste with salt and a small pinch of sugar to curb the acidity
132,562.88,568.64, Then stir in four tablespoons or 60 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil and that right there is a nice slap in good time
133,568.8,571.1199999999999, Of the sauce now since this pizza is a big man
134,571.2,576.08, We're gonna do three different toppings on one pizza a mushroom onion topping a plain cheese topping
135,576.16,579.44, Which is the base I guess and a pepperoni for the mushroom topping
136,579.44,584.88, It's real simple start with six ounces or 170 grams of button mushrooms cut those into eights or quarters depending on their size
137,584.96,588.0, In a large skillet add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan
138,588.4,592.8, Entirely heat that over a medium high until ripping hot then add in your mushrooms cut side down
139,592.88,596.4, Try not to overcrowd and let that sear for about two minutes or until deeply brown
140,596.48,601.4399999999999, Give them a toss let them continue to cook until soft then season it tastes with salt and black pepper and that's your
141,602.16,605.1999999999999, Now place those in a bowl clean out that same pan heat it back up over medium
142,605.28,611.68, High add another tablespoon or so of oil and add in one rough diced onion sauté that for four minutes or just until softened
143,611.84,616.64, Season it taste with salt add to your mushrooms then to that you're gonna add one teaspoon of finely chopped fresh thyme leaves
144,616.72,622.88," Toss together and that's your onion mush womb for the pepperoni. Well, you just need to slice pepperoni. It's not that crazy"
145,622.88,626.72," Okay, it's not rocket science. It's uh, it's pepperoni science. Okay, you should know that by now"
146,626.72,631.12," And if you want to be a real g of course, you'll slice your own pepperoni and you'll slice her nice and"
147,631.92,635.12, I went just under a half inch for each of my slices. What can I say?
148,635.28,640.32, Like I'm chunky now last of all is the cheese mix you'll need about two and a half cups of grated low moisture mozzarella
149,640.4,642.8, And three quarters of a cup of fresh grated parmigiano
150,643.92,646.72," I think that was my best pronunciation of that ever. It's pretty good, right?"
151,646.8,649.52, Can I just get a round of applause? Please just make me feel good about it
152,650.24,653.76, Now toss those together and you have a cheesy man now
153,653.84,658.48," Let's say you've got your proof dough nice and you've got the sauce plus toppings. Oh nice, dude"
154,658.72,664.24, Now you are allowed to assemble first take your dough's top off hit it with a nice generous layer of sauce
155,664.4,666.24, Spoon it around to coat the dough evenly
156,666.3199999999999,670.16, You will likely end up using about three quarters of your sauce the rest you can give in the fridge for your
157,670.64,671.76, pleasure
158,671.76,678.88," It's a uh, papa pleasure if you will from there let it rain a torrential downpour of cheese to your heart's desire across the entire pizza"
159,678.96,684.72, Leaving a slight border then hit a third of the pizza with your onion mushroom another third of it with well nothing because it's
160,684.96,690.88," Just cheese in a third with your pepperoni, which is arranged generously now pop that into your oven for 20 to 25 minutes"
161,690.88,693.68, Or until the cheese is deeply brown and caramelized
162,693.92,698.88," Oh, we said burn josh. No, okay some parts are a touch charred. All right, but we want the cheese"
163,699.12,702.48," Deeply brown is there a problem with that? No, it just means a little bit of"
164,703.36,705.36, Kind of like a nice lasagna
165,705.36,709.36," Now, absolutely you can top your onion mushroom with some frise and fresh shaved parmigiano-reggiano"
166,709.36,713.12, But that's up to you this finalizes our second and last pizza
167,713.2,717.2, Which will it be the famous classic neapolitan or the roman altagliano?
168,717.28,721.12, You know for the party people one is a little more upscale and one is meant for a crowd
169,721.28,724.32, So let's taste test this and see if there's a true winner
170,725.44,730.24, It's hot in here. It's hot outside and it's hot as in that ooni oven
171,731.52,733.12," Thank you. Yeah, I was gonna say the same thing"
172,733.2,738.5600000000001, It's funny because the pizza speaks for itself. Good lord the bottom's chart the outsize chart
173,739.68,745.2, You know a bit of acidity just the smell you know your brain your caveman like mine goes
174,745.44,748.5600000000001, This is yummy put it in you so we will and just a quick
175,753.36,755.36, Oh my lord
176,756.8,758.8, Look at this chrome structure. Here we go
177,759.68,765.5999999999999, Let me just stop myself for a second here. I feel like I've been transported to a terrace in italy
178,765.68,767.5999999999999," I wake up and then I'm like, oh, I'm in houston"
179,767.76,773.76, But hey this pizza brought me to a moment of bliss and that's because of that precious of now neopold and pizza aside
180,773.92,779.1999999999999, Let's talk about the roman style pizza now. There are many different kinds of roman pizza. We went with the altaglio
181,780.0,785.5999999999999, Not the best pronunciation. Okay pepperoni a cheese and whatever this is. I kind of want the onion one
182,786.16,791.76, Mm. That's pretty busting too. This is a totally different experience crunch of the crust ultra rich
183,792.08,796.88, Deeply flavored it like punches you in the face. You taste it and it tastes good and then out of nowhere the flavor is just like
